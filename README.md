# Stock_market_analysis_and_prediction
This project is used to analyze the previous stock data of certain companies using API, reading the pattern of different stocks and visualizing it with the help of Tableau. Lastly, predict the values of particular stock using LSTM.

This project is driven by the goal of creating a prototype that can assist investors, traders, and financial analysts in making informed decisions.
Key components of the project include data collection, pre-processing, data Fetching, visualization, and predictive modelling.
1. **Data Collection**: We have retrieved historical stock data from a company  with an open source APIs to ensure our analysis is based on accurate and up-to-date information.
2. **Database Integration**: We have integrated MySQL database into our project to efficiently store and manage the data fetched from the API.
3. **LSTM for Stock Prediction**: The LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), is employed to forecast stock prices.
4. **Visualization with Streamlit**: The power of visualization is harnessed through Streamlit, enabling us to present data in an intuitive and insightful manner.

## Highlighting the Trend and Fluctuations:
- The line graph vividly illustrates the predicted opening prices over a specified time horizon.
- We use this graph to highlight trends and fluctuations in the stock's value, offering valuable insights into potential market movements.
- The upward and downward movements, peaks, and valleys all provide valuable information for investors and analysts.

To provide an enhanced user experience and make our Stock Market Analysis Project more accessible, we've incorporated Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web applications. 

- **Stock Matrix Visualization**: Our Streamlit-powered web application includes a dynamic stock matrix that allows users to select and visualize multiple stocks simultaneously.
- **Date Range Selection**: Users can specify custom date ranges to focus on specific periods of interest. This flexibility enables detailed analysis of stock trends over specific time frames.
- **Two Prediction Options (30 and 60 Days)**: We've integrated predictive modeling directly into our web application, offering users the ability to forecast stock prices for two intervals.
